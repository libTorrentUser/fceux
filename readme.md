Branch of [FCEUX](https://github.com/TASVideos/fceux) where I implemented a couple of extra features
- **user defined "base directory" for Linux builds.** Yes. Now you can choose where the config, save states etc will be stored. Just pass the directory in the commandline using `--base-directory`
- **rotating save states.** Each time you press `1`, a new save state will be created. And when you press `0`, the last save state you created will be loaded. The save states are saved on the regular save state slots (0-9) so, in case of you to go to a previous one, just manually load that state. There are only 10 slots so, when all of them are filled, the emulator will start overwriting the oldest ones.
